We will also delve into semi-empirical approximations of the theory, including well-known models like Wilson, NRTL, UNIQUAC, and others. These models have been pivotal in advancing our understanding of solution thermodynamics and play a key role in various applications, including phase equilibria and mixture property prediction. Original quasi-chemical model The quasi-chemical model was pioneered by Guggenheim 1 in 1940s as a thermodynamic model to describe the non-random arrangement of molecules in a mixture, particularly in liquids. In its original version, it is based on a lattice picture of the liquid state assuming interactions only between nearest neighbour compounds. In this framework, interactions can be interpreted as chemical reactions at equilibrium. For a binary mixture of compounds A and B , the following reaction holds: AA + BB \\rightleftharpoons 2 AB When either compound A or compound B is pure, they can only interact with other identical molecules, forming AA or BB pairs. However, in mixtures, there exists an equilibrium between AA , BB , and AB complexes. Using the notation introduced by Soares and Staudt 2 , there should be Boltzmann factor \\Psi_{AB} in terms of the pair formation (or interaction) energy u_{AB} = u_{BA} , given by: \\Psi_{AB} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u_{AB}}{kT}\\right) Then, the probability of finding AB pairs would be given by: \\theta_{AB}^2 = \\theta_{AA} \\theta_{BB} \\frac{\\Psi_{AB}^2}{\\Psi_{AA} \\Psi_{BB}} Note: The above equation is equivalent to the quasi-chemical treatment, Eq.(4.09.1) of Guggenheim 1 . If the mixture where to be completely random: \\theta_{AB} = \\Theta_{A} \\Theta_{B} , where \\Theta_{A} is the surface area fraction of compound A in mixture. Extensions in terms of groups or small segments In its original and simplest form, the quasi-chemical method is expressed in molecular terms, which imposes several limitations on the model. For instance, the model is unable to describe positive excess entropies (found for instance in the acetone/ n -heptane system). The simple preference for cross-compound interactions invariably leads to an increase in order within the mixture 3 . In a more sophisticated form (assuming the presence of functional groups with different interaction energies), quasi-chemical models become quite flexible. However, expressing the problem in terms of groups results in an expanded set of equations that need to be solved. Notably, Panayiotou 4 have already presented a formulation in terms of surface area fractions in the 1980s and shortly after Larsen 5 investigated the numerical solution of the resulting system of equations. The surface fragmentation can be further refined to small surface segments , as depicted below 2 : This refinement results in sets of equations equivalent to those used in COSMO-RS 6 or COSMO-SAC 7 models. Many studies have recognized COSMO-based models as equivalent to the quasi-chemical treatment 8 6 9 10 2 . Elliott 11 extends this concept by characterizing COSMO-RS/SAC models as Small Segment Quasi-Chemical Theory (SS-QCT), considering them essentially equivalent , despite the absence of an explicit lattice reference. We prefer to refer to this category of models simply as modern quasi-chemical models. Semi-empirical approximations When no additional approximations are assumed, quasi-chemical models lack explicit expressions for activity coefficients, requiring the solution of a set of non-linear equations 5 . Many semi-empirical developments - like Wilson 12 , NRTL 13 , and UNIQUAC 14 - originate from quasi-chemical theory, but their simplifications allow for explicit expressions for the activity coefficients 5 . These models became widely used due to their simplicity and flexibility 3 . UNIFAC (UNIQUAC Functional-group Activity Coefficients) original 15 and modified versions like the UNIFAC (Do) 16 are still usually very good options when one needs to predict activity coefficients.

Stay tuned for updates!","title":"Binary Mixture Charts"},{"location":"cosmo-sac/","text":"COSMO-SAC Variants In this section, we describe the different COSMO-SAC variants currently available in JCOSMO . Over the years, several versions of COSMO-SAC have been developed to improve the description of intermolecular interactions, hydrogen bonding, etc. Each variant introduces changes to specific components of the model \u2014 such as the sigma-profile generation, the segment interaction energy expression, or the combinatorial term. JCOSMO provides the implementation of multiple COSMO-SAC variants, so users can explore their relative performance and applicability. The variant can be selected via the combobox in the top left corner of JCOSMO user interface, allowing users to benchmark and validate different formulations under consistent computational settings. Note: Compatibility between sigma profiles and the chosen COSMO-SAC variant is essential. Always ensure that sigma-profiles were generated using the corresponding assumptions (e.g., level of theory, basis set, cavity construction, etc.). CS25 The LVPP-modified COSMO-SAC 2025 model represents our latest COSMO-SAC parametrization, referred to simply as CS25 . Sigma-Profiles CS25 is based on sigma-profiles calculated using NWChem 1 as the quantum chemical package, in contrast to previous parametrizations that relied on GAMESS. The level of theory employed is B3LYP/def2-SVPD . Molecular geometries were first optimized in the gas phase, followed by a single-point calculation with the COSMO solvation model to generate the sigma-profiles 2 . The def2-SVPD basis set was chosen as a balance between accuracy and computational cost, offering improved polarization treatment and broader elemental coverage compared to the TZVP basis set used previously. For larger molecules, the def2-SVP basis set was adopted to reduce computational demand, with negligible loss of accuracy in the resulting sigma-profiles. Multiple Hydrogen Bond Types In this parametrization, different types of hydrogen bonds (HBs) are explicitly considered. Two types of HB donors are defined: one corresponding to water molecules and another representing hydrogens bonded to electronegative atoms such as N, O, F, Cl, Br, or I. In the user interface, all these donor types are collectively referred to as alcohol donors. Only the surface area fraction with a charge density exceeding the defined HB cutoff value is assumed to be capable of participating in HBs. For HB acceptors, several categories are available: ketone , ether , amine , and F+ . Some special cases apply to nitrogen-containing groups: When nitrogen is bonded to a single atom (e.g., in nitriles), it is treated as a ketone -type acceptor. When bonded to two atoms (e.g., in pyridine), it is treated as an ether -type acceptor. Dispersion Contribution The original COSMO-SAC model typically disregarded dispersion interactions 3 , assuming that their effects would cancel out in excess properties. In CS25 , a dedicated dispersion contribution is included for each pair of atoms. This is achieved by storing, along with the surface charge density (sigma-profile), the atom type associated with each surface segment. Although the resulting dispersion term is generally small, it provides a subtle yet meaningful correction that improves the description of nearly athermal mixtures, systems dominated by weak interactions, and particularly fluorinated/hydrocarbon mixtures , where dispersion effects play a more significant role. Combinatorial contribution A modified Flory-Huggins (FH) equation is used for the combinatorial contribution 4 : \\ln\\ \\gamma^{\\rm{comb}}_{i} = \\ln \\frac{\\Phi_i'}{x_i} + 1 - \\frac{\\Phi_i'}{x_i} where \\Phi_i' \\equiv x_i r_i^p / \\sum_j x_j r_j^p is the modified volume fraction, r_i is the molecular volume of compound i obtained from the COSMO calculations, x_i is the mole fraction of component i , and p is an empirical exponent 5 . This is in contrast to the typical Staverman-Guggenheim (SG) term with a normalized area 6 7 . The reason for using FH is because the potential inconsistencies with the SG formula 8 . When the exponent p = 1 , the expression reduces to the original FH form. This classical formula is known to overestimate the combinatorial contribution, effectively providing an upper limit 5 . In CS25 , an exponent of p = \\tfrac{2}{3} is used, based on comparisons with experimental data for aliphatic hydrocarbons 4 . COSMO-SAC-HB2 The LVPP-modified COSMO-SAC model with multiple hydrogen-bond (HB) energy types, improving the description of systems where different donor and acceptor strengths play a significant role. Three parametrizations are available, depending on the quantum chemistry package and level of theory used to generate the sigma-profiles: COSMO-SAC-HB2 (GAMESS) 9 : based on sigma-profiles computed with GAMESS using the HF/TZVP level of theory. COSMO-SAC-HB2 (FINE) 10 : based on TURBOMOLE calculations employing a fine-grid marching tetrahedron cavity and the BP/TZVPD level of theory. COSMO-SAC-HB2 (BP-TZVP) 10 : based on TURBOMOLE calculations using the BP/TZVP level of theory. All variants in this section use FH as the combinatorial contribution ( p = 1 in the modified FH formula), and none includes a dispersive contribution. E. Apr\u00e0, E. J. Bylaska, W. A. De Jong, N.

We will also discuss the incorporation of mixing rules, both classical and advanced, which allow these equations to be applied to multicomponent systems. Cubic equations of state To define the thermodynamic state of a pure substance in a single phase, two thermodynamic properties are required. An equation of state provides a mathematical relationship that allows the determination of an unknown property from two known variables. This requires mathematical relations that are functions of temperature ( T ), pressure ( P ), and specific volume ( v ), which are intensive properties that can be determined experimentally 1 . There are numerous forms of equations of state in the literature, and the most commonly employed are the cubic equations of state . These are third-degree polynomial equations in volume, whose roots can be obtained through various solution methods. A key advantage is that they always yield three roots, allowing for a predictable number of possible solutions 2 . In 1873, van der Waals 3 attempted to overcome the limitations of the ideal gas law, which neglects intermolecular forces and assumes that gas molecules occupy negligible volume. He proposed that gas molecules possess finite volume at high pressures and introduced a covolume parameter, b , subtracted from the molar volume. To account for molecular interactions, he included the term a/v^2 , where a represents attractive forces between molecules. The resulting expression is: P(T, v) = \\frac{RT}{v - b} - \\frac{a}{v^2} Here, a and b are parameters determined from critical point data for pure substances. The parameter b represents the molar volume limit as P \\rightarrow \\infty, and v \\rightarrow b 3 . Based on his work, Redlich and Kwong 4 observed that the a/v^2 term did not account for the influence of temperature on attractive molecular forces. Thus, they introduced a temperature dependency in the attractive term: P(T, v) = \\frac{RT}{v - b} - \\frac{a / \\sqrt{T}}{v(v + b)} This modification provided a better representation of several systems. However, as the parameter a remained constant, Soave 5 proposed a widely used modification, known as SRK (Soave\u2013Redlich\u2013Kwong), where a is replaced with a temperature-dependent function \\alpha : \\alpha(T_r, \\omega) = \\left[ 1 + (0.480 + 1.574 \\omega - 0.176 \\omega^2)(1 - \\sqrt{T_r}) \\right]^2 Here, \\omega is the acentric factor, and T_r = T/T_c is the reduced temperature, with T_c being the critical temperature and T the system temperature. Peng and Robinson 6 evaluated the SRK model for hydrocarbon systems and found it needed improvements, particularly for liquid densities near the critical point. They proposed the following modified expression, altering the volume dependence in the attractive term: P = \\frac{RT}{v - b} - \\frac{a \\alpha}{v(v + b) + b(v - b)} The terms a , b , and \\alpha(T) have the same interpretations as in the SRK model. The \\alpha(T) function was redefined as: \\alpha(T_r, \\omega) = \\left[ 1 + (0.37464 + 1.54226 \\omega - 0.26992 \\omega^2)(1 - \\sqrt{T_r}) \\right]^2 These equations of state are widely implemented in computational tools and offer reasonable estimates for thermodynamic properties. Nevertheless, they do not accurately represent all substances and mixtures. As a result, many modifications have been developed over time to better describe the behavior of diverse systems. Mathias and Copeman 7 developed an alpha funcition that is a modification designed to enhance the accuracy of PR and SRK equations in predicting fluid phase behavior. The standard alpha functions within these equations can sometimes produce inaccuracies, particularly when dealing with complex mixtures or a wide range of thermodynamic conditions. The Mathias-Copeman alpha function addresses these limitations by introducing additional adjustable parameters ( c_1 , c_2 , and c_3 ), thereby providing a more flexible and accurate representation of this temperature dependence. This increased flexibility allows for a better fit to experimental data, improving the equation\u2019s ability to model a broader range of substances and conditions. In essence, it acts as a replacement for the original alpha function within these equations, offering a refined approach to modeling the temperature-dependent behavior of fluids. This function is implemented in JCOSMO with the SRK model (SRK-MC). \\alpha_\\text{MC}\\left(T_r\\right)=\\left[1+c_1\\left(1-\\sqrt{T_r}\\right)+c_2\\left(1-\\sqrt{T_r}\\right)^2+c_3\\left(1-\\sqrt{T_r}\\right)^3\\right]^2 A general form of a cubic equation of state is expressed as: P(T, v) = \\frac{RT}{v - b} - \\frac{a(T)}{(v + \\epsilon b)(v + \\sigma b)} Where \\epsilon and \\sigma are constants specific to the equation of state used. The parameters a(T) and b are defined as: \\begin{aligned} a(T) &= \\Psi \\frac{\\alpha(T_r, \\omega) R^2 T_c^2}{P_c} \\\\ b &= \\Omega \\frac{RT_c}{P_c} \\end{aligned} The values of \\Psi , \\Omega , and \\alpha(T_r, \\omega) vary depending on the specific equation of state, as shown below. The subscript c refers to the critical point properties. The acentric factor \\omega is defined as 8 : \\omega = -1 - \\log \\left[ \\frac{P^{\\text{sat}}(T_r = 0.7)}{P_c} \\right] Where P^{\\text{sat}}(T_r = 0.7) is the saturation pressure at a reduced temperature of 0.7 T_r = 0.7 .

This is necessary because, for cubic equations of state, the parameters a and b for mixtures cannot be obtained directly as they are for pure compounds, where critical property data are used. Therefore, mixing rules establish mathematical relationships that relate the mixture parameters a and b to the parameters a_i and b_i of each pure component i . Classic vdW mixing rule The classic van der Waals mixing rule consists of a linear relation for the covolume b and a quadratic rule for the attractive parameter a : \\begin{gathered} a = \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} x_{i} x_{j} a_{ij} \\\\ b = \\sum_{i} x_{i} b_{i} \\end{gathered} where a is the mixture\u2019s attractive parameter, b is the mixture\u2019s covolume, x_i is the mole fraction of component i , b_i is the covolume of species i , and a_{ij} includes both pure component parameters (when i = j ) and interaction parameters (when i \\neq j ). The interaction parameters a_{ij} are calculated using the following combination rule based on a geometric mean: a_{ij} = \\sqrt{a_i a_j}(1 - k_{ij}) Here, k_{ij} is the binary interaction parameter between components i and j , typically fitted using experimental phase equilibrium data. While these parameters are often assumed to be zero, they are crucial for mixtures with significant deviations from ideality. Nevertheless, even with k_{ij} , these classical rule struggle to represent mixtures involving strong molecular interactions, such as polar mixtures (e.g., water and ethanol), due to the absence of temperature-dependent binary parameters 9 . By default, all k_{ij} = 0 within JCOSMO. MHV1 Huron and Vidal 10 in 1979 proposed a mixing rule based on excess Gibbs energy models g^E_\\gamma . They equated the excess Gibbs energy calculated using a cubic equation of state g^E_\\phi , at the limit P \\rightarrow \\infty , to the expression for g^E_\\gamma . Under this pressure condition, the molar volume is considered equal to the covolume b , and the expression for the a parameter is derived. Following the work of Huron and Vidal 10 , several other mixing rules were developed, including MHV-1 (Modified Huron-Vidal mixing rule) 11 12 , UMR (Universal Mixing Rule) 13 , the rule by Wong and Sandler 14 , and PSRK (Predictive Soave-Redlich-Kwong) 15 . Within JCOSMO MHV-1 can be combined with activity models to include pressure effects in such models. PSRK The PSRK (Predictive Soave-Redlich-Kwong) 15 combines the SRK equation with the \\alpha(T) function proposed by Mathias and Copeman shown previously, and a specific UNIFAC parametrization. To combine the SRK equation of state with the excess Gibbs energy model (UNIFAC), the MHV1 mixing rule was applied: \\begin{gathered} a = b \\left[\\frac{g_0^E}{A_1} + \\sum_i x_i \\frac{a_i}{b_i} + \\frac{RT}{A_1} \\sum_i x_i \\ln \\frac{b}{b_i}\\right] \\\\ b = \\sum_i x_i b_i \\end{gathered} where g_0^E is the excess Gibbs energy in the limit P \\rightarrow 0 , calculated using the UNIFAC model. In PSRK, the parameter A_1 is set to -0.64663. The UNIFAC parameter matrix used in PSRK includes six additional gases, and the most recent revision accepted by the UNIFAC consortium was presented by Horstmann in 2005 16 . PSRK is available within JCOSMO as one of the options for model comparison. SCMR All mixing rules described previously introduce distortions in phase equilibrium calculations at low pressures due to discrepancies between Gibbs excess calculated with the equation of state ( g^E_\\phi ) and with the activity model ( g^E_\\gamma ). Nonetheless, they provide satisfactory results for many mixtures with significant non-ideality, representing an improvement over the classical van der Waals rule. To overcome this limitation, Staudt and coworkers 17 developed a mixing rule that yields consistent results, where the excess Gibbs energy g^E_\\phi from the equation of state matches the excess Gibbs energy g^E_\\gamma from the activity coefficient model. Due to this consistency, regardless of the cubic equation of state used, the authors named the approach the SCMR (Self-Consistent Mixing Rule). This mixing rule was created by developers of JCOSMO, and it is implemented as an option when calculating phase equilibria. In this mixing rule, the following expression is used to calculate the excess Gibbs energy via an equation of state: \\frac{g^E_\\phi}{RT} = \\ln \\hat{\\phi} - \\sum_i x_i \\ln \\phi_i where \\hat{\\phi} is the fugacity coefficient of the mixture, and \\phi_i is the fugacity coefficient of the pure component i , both at the same temperature and pressure. From this equation, the authors made some assumptions, the main one being that excess volume is negligible. Consequently, they derived the following expression: q = \\frac{1}{I^{Id}} \\left( \\frac{g^E_\\gamma}{RT} - \\sum_i x_i \\ln \\left( \\frac{v_i - b_i}{v^{Id} - b} \\right) + \\sum_i x_i q_i I_i \\right) Here, the superscript Id denotes the ideal solution reference, the subscript i refers to each component, v is the molar volume, and q and I are defined as follows: \\begin{aligned} q_i &\\equiv \\frac{a_i}{b_i RT} \\\\ I_i &\\equiv I_0 \\ln \\left( \\frac{v_i + \\epsilon b_i}{v_i + \\sigma b_i} \\right) \\\\ I_0 &= \\frac{1}{\\sigma - \\epsilon} \\end{aligned} where \\epsilon and \\sigma are constants that depend on the chosen equation of state, as shown in the previous table.

We will also discuss the incorporation of mixing rules, both classical and advanced, which allow these equations to be applied to multicomponent systems.","title":"Cubic equations of state and mixing rules"},{"location":"cubic/#cubic-equations-of-state","text":"To define the thermodynamic state of a pure substance in a single phase, two thermodynamic properties are required. An equation of state provides a mathematical relationship that allows the determination of an unknown property from two known variables. This requires mathematical relations that are functions of temperature ( T ), pressure ( P ), and specific volume ( v ), which are intensive properties that can be determined experimentally 1 . There are numerous forms of equations of state in the literature, and the most commonly employed are the cubic equations of state . These are third-degree polynomial equations in volume, whose roots can be obtained through various solution methods. A key advantage is that they always yield three roots, allowing for a predictable number of possible solutions 2 . In 1873, van der Waals 3 attempted to overcome the limitations of the ideal gas law, which neglects intermolecular forces and assumes that gas molecules occupy negligible volume. He proposed that gas molecules possess finite volume at high pressures and introduced a covolume parameter, b , subtracted from the molar volume. To account for molecular interactions, he included the term a/v^2 , where a represents attractive forces between molecules. The resulting expression is: P(T, v) = \\frac{RT}{v - b} - \\frac{a}{v^2} Here, a and b are parameters determined from critical point data for pure substances. The parameter b represents the molar volume limit as P \\rightarrow \\infty, and v \\rightarrow b 3 . Based on his work, Redlich and Kwong 4 observed that the a/v^2 term did not account for the influence of temperature on attractive molecular forces. Thus, they introduced a temperature dependency in the attractive term: P(T, v) = \\frac{RT}{v - b} - \\frac{a / \\sqrt{T}}{v(v + b)} This modification provided a better representation of several systems. However, as the parameter a remained constant, Soave 5 proposed a widely used modification, known as SRK (Soave\u2013Redlich\u2013Kwong), where a is replaced with a temperature-dependent function \\alpha : \\alpha(T_r, \\omega) = \\left[ 1 + (0.480 + 1.574 \\omega - 0.176 \\omega^2)(1 - \\sqrt{T_r}) \\right]^2 Here, \\omega is the acentric factor, and T_r = T/T_c is the reduced temperature, with T_c being the critical temperature and T the system temperature. Peng and Robinson 6 evaluated the SRK model for hydrocarbon systems and found it needed improvements, particularly for liquid densities near the critical point. They proposed the following modified expression, altering the volume dependence in the attractive term: P = \\frac{RT}{v - b} - \\frac{a \\alpha}{v(v + b) + b(v - b)} The terms a , b , and \\alpha(T) have the same interpretations as in the SRK model. The \\alpha(T) function was redefined as: \\alpha(T_r, \\omega) = \\left[ 1 + (0.37464 + 1.54226 \\omega - 0.26992 \\omega^2)(1 - \\sqrt{T_r}) \\right]^2 These equations of state are widely implemented in computational tools and offer reasonable estimates for thermodynamic properties. Nevertheless, they do not accurately represent all substances and mixtures. As a result, many modifications have been developed over time to better describe the behavior of diverse systems. Mathias and Copeman 7 developed an alpha funcition that is a modification designed to enhance the accuracy of PR and SRK equations in predicting fluid phase behavior. The standard alpha functions within these equations can sometimes produce inaccuracies, particularly when dealing with complex mixtures or a wide range of thermodynamic conditions. The Mathias-Copeman alpha function addresses these limitations by introducing additional adjustable parameters ( c_1 , c_2 , and c_3 ), thereby providing a more flexible and accurate representation of this temperature dependence. This increased flexibility allows for a better fit to experimental data, improving the equation\u2019s ability to model a broader range of substances and conditions. In essence, it acts as a replacement for the original alpha function within these equations, offering a refined approach to modeling the temperature-dependent behavior of fluids. This function is implemented in JCOSMO with the SRK model (SRK-MC). \\alpha_\\text{MC}\\left(T_r\\right)=\\left[1+c_1\\left(1-\\sqrt{T_r}\\right)+c_2\\left(1-\\sqrt{T_r}\\right)^2+c_3\\left(1-\\sqrt{T_r}\\right)^3\\right]^2 A general form of a cubic equation of state is expressed as: P(T, v) = \\frac{RT}{v - b} - \\frac{a(T)}{(v + \\epsilon b)(v + \\sigma b)} Where \\epsilon and \\sigma are constants specific to the equation of state used.

While these parameters are often assumed to be zero, they are crucial for mixtures with significant deviations from ideality. Nevertheless, even with k_{ij} , these classical rule struggle to represent mixtures involving strong molecular interactions, such as polar mixtures (e.g., water and ethanol), due to the absence of temperature-dependent binary parameters 9 .

Nonetheless, they provide satisfactory results for many mixtures with significant non-ideality, representing an improvement over the classical van der Waals rule. To overcome this limitation, Staudt and coworkers 17 developed a mixing rule that yields consistent results, where the excess Gibbs energy g^E_\\phi from the equation of state matches the excess Gibbs energy g^E_\\gamma from the activity coefficient model. Due to this consistency, regardless of the cubic equation of state used, the authors named the approach the SCMR (Self-Consistent Mixing Rule). This mixing rule was created by developers of JCOSMO, and it is implemented as an option when calculating phase equilibria. In this mixing rule, the following expression is used to calculate the excess Gibbs energy via an equation of state: \\frac{g^E_\\phi}{RT} = \\ln \\hat{\\phi} - \\sum_i x_i \\ln \\phi_i where \\hat{\\phi} is the fugacity coefficient of the mixture, and \\phi_i is the fugacity coefficient of the pure component i , both at the same temperature and pressure. From this equation, the authors made some assumptions, the main one being that excess volume is negligible. Consequently, they derived the following expression: q = \\frac{1}{I^{Id}} \\left( \\frac{g^E_\\gamma}{RT} - \\sum_i x_i \\ln \\left( \\frac{v_i - b_i}{v^{Id} - b} \\right) + \\sum_i x_i q_i I_i \\right) Here, the superscript Id denotes the ideal solution reference, the subscript i refers to each component, v is the molar volume, and q and I are defined as follows: \\begin{aligned} q_i &\\equiv \\frac{a_i}{b_i RT} \\\\ I_i &\\equiv I_0 \\ln \\left( \\frac{v_i + \\epsilon b_i}{v_i + \\sigma b_i} \\right) \\\\ I_0 &= \\frac{1}{\\sigma - \\epsilon} \\end{aligned} where \\epsilon and \\sigma are constants that depend on the chosen equation of state, as shown in the previous table.

This section provides a quick overview to help you get started with JCOSMO and make the most of its powerful modeling capabilities. Check how to search for compounds , view sigma surfaces and profiles , and predict activity coefficients, VLE, and more. Follow the steps in this guide to quickly familiarize yourself with these features and start using JCOSMO effectively for your simulations and analysis. Search and select compounds You can search the database by entering part of a compound\u2019s name and hitting ENTER or clicking Search . Once found, select the desired compound and use the Add button or hit ENTER again. The selected compounds are used it in the calculations available in JCOSMO . View sigma-surfaces Once you have selected one or more molecules, you can view the sigma-surfaces by clicking the View Surfaces button: For each compound, the COSMO 3D surface of induced charge densities (sigma-surface) is shown. The standard color convention is: green for neutral (apolar) regions, red for induced positive charges, and blue for induced negative charges. These induced charges arise due to differences in electronegativity between atoms within a molecule. For example, oxygen is highly electronegative and tends to attract electron density, inducing a positive charge (shown in red). Conversely, hydrogen atoms in polar bonds (such as O-H or N-H) tend to lose electron density and thus induce a negative charge (shown in blue) on themselves. This charge distribution is obtained using the COSMO method , which models the molecule as being embedded in a perfect conductor , similar to a liquid metal. This approximation allows the calculation of charge polarization at the molecular surface, leading to the sigma-surface representation. In addition to the sigma-surface, the compound\u2019s molecular volume, surface area, and molar mass are also displayed. Activity coefficients, Excess, and Mixture properties If exactly two compounds are selected, the Binary tab can be used to display the activity coefficient chart. Just click on Calculate and the logarithm of the activity coefficients chart is calculated. Recalling that when a compound is pure, \\ln \\gamma_i = 0 , and when its mole fraction tends to zero, we reach the infinite dilution limit: \\ln \\gamma_i = \\ln \\gamma_i^\\infty . The actual infinite dilution values are also displayed at the bottom of the page: When mixing cyclohexane and sec-butanol , the mixture shows positive deviations from ideality , meaning the logarithm of the activity coefficients are positive with the compounds thermodynamically uncomfortable in the mixture compared to their pure states. In this case, this behavior arises mainly from differences in molecular interactions . Sec-butanol molecules can form hydrogen bonds with each other. Introducing cyclohexane disrupts these interactions, reducing the stabilization provided by hydrogen bonding. The user can also play with the checkboxes at the top: ln Gamma : displays the logarithm of the activity coefficients (default) Excess : displays the mixture excess properties Mixture : displays the mixture properties, recalling excess Gibbs and Entropy differ from mixture Gibbs and Entropy Dimensionless (1/RT) : dimensionless (or divided by RT) properties are used (default), otherwise J/mol or J/g are used Mass based : Use mass-based calculations instead of the default molar basis Sigma profiles A sigma profile is a molecule-specific distribution of charge density across a solute\u2019s surface, used in COSMO-based models to describe intermolecular interactions. It represents the fraction of the surface area associated with a given screening charge density ( \\sigma ). Now, let\u2019s view a sigma profile in JCOSMO. Simply navigate to the Profile tab and click Refresh \u2014the profiles for all selected compounds will be displayed. Cyclohexane is a nonpolar molecule, meaning its sigma profile is concentrated around zero charge density . This indicates a surface largely free of significant electrostatic interactions, making cyclohexane a typical example of a neutral, nonpolar solvent in COSMO-based models. For sec-butanol , the presence of the hydroxyl (-OH) group introduces regions of polarization . The oxygen atom in the hydroxyl group tends to accumulate electron density , leading to induced positive charge densities on nearby surface segments. Conversely, the hydrogen of the hydroxyl group becomes electron-deficient , contributing to negative induced charge densities . However, despite these polar contributions, a substantial portion of sec-butanol\u2019s surface remains neutral , reflecting the balance between its hydrophobic alkyl chain and hydrophilic hydroxyl group . This difference in sigma profiles explains why cyclohexane cannot donate or accept hydrogen bonds, while sec-butanol can participate in hydrogen bonding while still retaining some nonpolar character. VLE \u2014 vapor-liquid equilibrium To predict an isothermal vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) , navigate to the VLE tab and click Recalc . This will generate the equilibrium data based on the selected model. Please note that two compounds must be selected before proceeding with the prediction. You can also compare the predictions with other models (e.g. UNIFAC (Do) ) by selecting it in the comparison combobox , as shown below: By default, the predictions are based on the assumption that modified Raoult\u2019s law holds: P y_i = x_i \\gamma_i P_i^{sat} In this system, the VLE exhibits positive deviations from ideal behavior, the activity coefficients are greater than one, reflecting the unfavorable interactions between the components. These interactions cause the components to escape into the vapor phase more readily, increasing the bubble pressure compared to an ideal mixture. Comparison with experimental data In addition to pure predictions, JCOSMO can also compare model responses with experimental data. To do this, simply select Experiment... and navigate to a text file containing the experimental data. JCOSMO includes a small selection of experimental data in its data folder: jcosmo3 \u251c\u2500\u2500 jcosmo.exe \u251c\u2500\u2500 jcosmo.sh \u251c\u2500\u2500 data \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 vle # Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 lle # Liquid-Liquid Equilibrium \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 sle # Solid-Liquid Equilibrium \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 ... \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... For the cyclohexane/sec-butanol system, experimental data is available for 323.15 K . When this experimental file is selected, the results shown above are displayed. For this particular case, both the selected COSMO-SAC variant and UNIFAC (Do) produce predictions that closely match the available experimental data, including the azeotrope. However, COSMO-based models , such as COSMO-SAC , offer several advantages over group contribution methods like UNIFAC . One key advantage is that COSMO-based models rely on information derived from quantum chemistry calculations. Unlike UNIFAC , which uses predefined group interactions that have to be calibrated with experimental data. Thus, COSMO-based models are less reliant on empirical data and can be applied to a broader range of systems, including those with limited or no group contributions. This makes COSMO-based models particularly useful for systems with complex interactions or for predicting properties of new, uncharacterized compounds. LLE \u2014 liquid-liquid equilibrium JCOSMO also provides a framework for predicting liquid-liquid equilibrium (LLE) , navigate to the LLE tab and click Recalc . Please note that two compounds must be selected before proceeding with the prediction. Additionally, LLE occurs when a binary or multicomponent liquid mixture separates into two immiscible liquid phases at equilibrium. This phase separation is mostly driven by differences in molecular interactions. However, not all binary mixtures will undergo phase separation. Some systems remain fully miscible across all compositions. In that case, no predictions will be made. If the Gibbs energy curve exhibits a double-well shape with a common tangent, the mixture is predicted to split into two liquid phases. In JCOSMO, the compositions of the two coexisting phases ( x^{\\alpha} and x^{\\beta} ) at the initial temperature point are determined using a dividing rectangles global search algorithm. If a valid two-phase system is identified for the selected mixture, subsequent calculations follow the isoactivity criterion for liquid phases \\alpha and \\beta : x_i^{\\alpha} \\gamma_i^{\\alpha} = x_i^{\\beta} \\gamma_i^{\\beta} As for VLEs, the user can perform either pure predictions by clicking on Recalc or compare the results with experimental data by selecting the Experiment... button. Results for the system n -pentanol/water are shown below: SLE \u2014 solid-liquid equilibrium JCOSMO can also perform solid-liquid equilibrium (SLE) calculations. The standard calculations assume a pure compound in the solid phase, surrounded by a liquid phase. Under this assumption, and with the further considerations that there is no phase transition and that the heat capacity difference between the solid and liquid phases is negligible, the following relation holds: x_i \\gamma_i = \\exp \\left( \\frac{ -\\Delta H_i^{\\text{fus}} \\left( 1 - \\frac{T}{T_i^{\\text{fus}}} \\right)}{ R T } \\right) where: x_i is the mole fraction of the solute in the liquid phase, \\gamma_i is the activity coefficient of the solute in the liquid phase, \\Delta H_i^{\\text{fus}} is the solute enthalpy of fusion, T_i^{\\text{fus}} is the solute fusion temperature, R is the universal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature. Note that JCOSMO can also predict SLE with up to two solid transition temperatures and with a non-zero heat capacity difference between solid and liquid. As usual, the user can perform either pure predictions by clicking on Recalc or compare the results with experimental data by selecting the Experiment... button.

UNIFAC Introduced in 1975 by Fredenslund et al. 1 , the UNIFAC model (UNIQUAC Functional-group Activity Coefficients) is a group-contribution method developed for predicting activity coefficients in nonelectrolyte liquid mixtures. In this approach, molecules are represented as assemblies of functional groups, with thermodynamic properties estimated as the sum of contributions from these individual groups. This method is particularly advantageous for mixture modeling, as it enables the reuse of group parameters across different compounds, expanding coverage of the chemical space while reducing the need for extensive experimental data. In UNIFAC, the molecular activity coefficient is made of two parts, one combinatorial and one residual: \\ln \\gamma_{i} = \\ln \\gamma_{i}^{C} + \\ln \\gamma_{i}^{R} Combinatorial : provides the contribution due to differences in molecular size and shape.

It\u2019s initial scope of compounds and temperature range was expanded with new developments. Inside JCOSMO several UNIFAC variants are available, in the following sections these variants will be described briefly. UNIFAC-LLE As a development to the original UNIFAC model, in 1981 Magnussen et al. 2 proposed a parameter table specially calculated for Liquid-Liquid Equilibira (LLE). Changing the data used for estimation of the UNIFAC prameters from VLE data to LLE data reduced the AAD for ternary LLE systems in almost 80\\%. While UNIFAC-LLE is limited to the available parameters, it still retain some advantages when working with molecules and systems that were part of the parameter estimation process. UNIFAC(Do) With the purpose of calculating vapor-liquid equilibria, activity coefficients at infinite dilution and enthalpies of mixing with just one set of parameters, Weidlich and Gmehling 3 modified the UNIFAC method with what is now known as UNIFAC(Do) - (Modified UNIFAC - Dortmund). UNIFAC(PSRK) The application of cubic equations of state (EoS) for the description of systems with supercritical compounds is a way to reduce the deviations in the model\u2019s predictions. For this purpose an approach with a coupled Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) equation with the original UNIFAC model was developed, UNIFAC(PSRK) 4 . This model allows an accurate prediction of phase equilibrium in a wide temperature and pressure range. Beside phase equilibria, equations of state provide other thermodynamic properties (enthalpies, densities). UNIFAC-NIST As more experimental data becomes available, there is a need for periodic updates of the parameter matrix of models to reflect the most recent information for phase equilibrium. UNIFAC-NIST 5 is a modified UNIFAC (with the same expression that of UNIFAC(Do) for both the combinatorial and residual contributions) with model parameters estimated with critically evaluated phase equilibrium data including vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium (VLE), liquid\u2013liquid equilibrium (LLE), solid\u2013liquid equilibrium (SLE), excess enthalpy (HE), infinite dilution activity coefficient (IDAC) and excess heat capacity (CPE) data. Data collected within the NIST SOURCE Data Archival System and processed through NIST ThermoData Engine were used in the parameter optimization process. Aage Fredenslund, Russell L.

(2007) 2 , which constitute the main theoretical basis for the VLE description presented here. Additional references are cited when relevant to specific aspects or extensions of their approach. Theory concepts The separation of a mixture into a liquid phase and a vapor phase is of great importance and utility for the chemical, petrochemical, natural gas, and other industries. The separation process is founded in the phase equilibrium, which describes the conditions under which different phases of a pure substance or a mixture can coexist in thermodynamic equilibrium. An equilibrium system is often represented for two phases, as shown in the figure below. This system is divided into phases \\alpha and \\beta , which for VLE represent a liquid phase and a vapor phase. For the system to be in equilibrium, it is essential that its thermodynamic variables remain constant with respect to both time and position, without the presence of a driving force to induce changes. Schematic representation of the equilibrium between two generic phases. There are some criteria for an equilibrium occur. Firstly, if there were a pressure imbalance in the system, it would tend to contract or expand until its pressure equalized with that of its surroundings. Thus, for a system to be in equilibrium, mechanical equilibrium is essential, with no pressure variations: P^{\\alpha} = P^{\\beta} \\tag{1} Similarly, for temperature, if the system had a different temperature from its surroundings, a driving force would exist for energy transfer in the form of heat until they become equal. Therefore, for a system to be in equilibrium, thermal equilibrium must exist: T^{\\alpha} = T^{\\beta} \\tag{2} However, these two criteria are not sufficient to define thermodynamic equilibrium. Chemical equilibrium must also occur, which is established when there is no tendency for any component of the mixture to change phase or react chemically. The driving force for mass transfer is the difference in the chemical potential \\mu_i of the species between the phases, which translates to the partial molar Gibbs energy of the components present in the system: \\mu_{i} = \\overline{G}_{i} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial n_{i}}\\right)_{T, P, n_{j \\neq i}} \\tag{3} Thus, for equilibrium to occur, the chemical potential of each component i must be equal in all phases: \\mu_{i}^{\\alpha} = \\mu_{i}^{\\beta} \\tag{4} Thermodynamic equilibrium, therefore, requires all three criteria to be met. For a pure component, the chemical potential is simply the molar Gibbs energy of the substance. The focus here will be on mixtures, as the equilibrium for a pure substance is a special case of the equations that will be described. Fugacity and Activity Coefficients Using chemical potential to formulate phase equilibrium presents some mathematical challenges. The first relates to infinite dilution and the second to the scenario where pressure approaches zero, corresponding to the ideal gas limit. In both situations, the chemical potential tends towards negative infinity, creating mathematical inconveniences. To circumvent this problem, a new thermodynamic property is introduced as an alternative to chemical potential, called fugacity f : \\mu_{i} - \\mu_{i}^{\\circ} \\equiv RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\hat{f}_{i}}{f_{i}^{\\circ}}\\right) \\tag{5} where \\hat{f}_i represents the fugacity of component i in a mixture, and f_i^{\\circ} is its fugacity at an arbitrary reference state. Substituting Equation 5 into Equation 4, the criterion for chemical equilibrium can be described in terms of fugacity: \\hat{f}_{i}^{\\alpha} = \\hat{f}_{i}^{\\beta} \\tag{6} A commonly used reference point is an ideal gas mixture. Thus, the definition of fugacity is extended for this condition: \\lim_{P\\to0} \\left(\\frac{\\hat{f}_{i}}{y_{i}P}\\right) \\equiv 1 \\tag{7} where \\hat{f}_{i}^{IG}= y_i P and y_i is the mole fraction of substance i in the vapor phase. For an ideal gas, the fugacity is simply the partial pressure. The ratio \\hat{f}_i / (y_i P) is defined as the fugacity coefficient ( \\hat{\\phi}_i ) of specie i in a mixture: \\hat{\\phi}_{i} \\equiv \\frac{\\hat{f}_{i}}{\\hat{f}_{i}^{IG}} = \\frac{\\hat{f}_{i}}{y_{i}P} \\tag{8} The fugacity coefficient is a dimensionless variable that compares the fugacity of substance i to the fugacity of the component in an ideal gas mixture, giving an idea of how far from ideality that species is in the mixture. When characterizing an incompressible liquid phase, one often resorts to a reference condition other than an ideal gas mixture. In this case, the use of an ideal solution reference is more common. In this context, the fugacity of specie i in an ideal solution (\\hat{f}_i^{id}) is assumed to show a linear relationship with the fugacity of component i in its pure state (f_i) and its mole fraction in the liquid (x_i) . Thus, the fugacity of component i in a mixture, when at the reference state of an ideal liquid, is expressed by: \\hat{f}_{i}^{id} = x_{i}f_{i} \\tag{9} Analogous to Equation 7, when considering the ideal solution standard state, we can define the activity coefficient (\\gamma_i) of component i in the mixture: \\gamma_{i} \\equiv \\frac{\\hat{f}_{i}}{\\hat{f}_{i}^{id}} = \\frac{\\hat{f}_{i}}{x_{i}f_{i}} \\tag{10} The activity coefficient serves as an indicator of the non-ideality of species in a liquid, reflecting the interactions present and the effects of molecular structure, in comparison to the ideal solution reference. The fugacity of the pure component (f_i) can be determined through the following relation: f_i = \\phi_i^{sat} P_i^{sat} \\exp\\left[\\frac{v_i^L(P - P_i^{sat})}{RT}\\right]\\tag{11} where P_i^{sat} is the saturation pressure of pure component i , \\phi_i^{sat} is the fugacity coefficient of the pure component at saturation, v_i^L is the molar volume of pure component i in the liquid phase, and R is the universal gas constant. The exponential term is called the Poynting factor and is usually negligible at pressures below 100 bar. Furthermore, when pressure P is low, \\phi_i^{sat} \\approx 1 , and the previous equation can be simplified to: f_i \\approx P_i^{sat} \\tag{12} Therefore, care must be taken to use the activity coefficient only for liquids at low to moderate pressures. The concept of what constitutes a low or moderate pressure is broad and depends on the mixture being analyzed; factors such as strong or weak interactions between compounds and entropic effects related to the molecular structure of the species will impact the pressure up to which the activity coefficient can be used to describe the liquid phase. VLE Modeling Approaches The formulation of VLE can be done in different ways, depending on the mixture and system conditions. 1. Modified Raoult\u2019s Law (Gamma-Phi) For low to moderate pressures, the vapor phase can be approximated as an ideal gas. Under these conditions, the activity coefficient can be used for the liquid phase and the fugacity coefficient for the vapor phase is assumed to be 1 (ideal gas). The equation for the equality of fugacities becomes: y_{i}P = x_{i}\\gamma_{i}P_{i}^{sat} \\tag{13} Equation 13 is called the modified Raoult\u2019s Law and accounts for non-idealities in the liquid phase. To use Equation 13, models that relate the activity coefficient to the liquid composition (x_i) and temperature (T) are necessary, such as some of the presented in the Theory section of this documentation. Examples are the well-known NRTL (Non-Random Two-Liquid model) 3 , the UNIQUAC (Universal Quasichemical) model 4 , the UNIFAC model 5 , and the COSMO-SAC model 6 . Another important variable is the saturation pressure P_i^{sat} , which is generally obtained experimentally and then correlated with a model as a function of temperature. Typically, the Antoine equation 7 is used, which is an exponential function with three adjustable parameters: P_i^{sat} = \\exp\\left(A - \\frac{B}{T+C}\\right) \\tag{14} where A , B , and C are parameters fitted to experimental data. It is crucial to check the units of pressure and temperature used by the reference source before using parameters from the literature, as the form of the Antoine equation can vary (e.g., using log base 10 instead of a natural exponent). JCOSMO supports several types of saturation pressure correlations, and this is further discussed in the practical example section. 2. Phi-Phi Method The second possibility for VLE modeling is to use the fugacity coefficient for both the liquid and vapor phases. This is done for mixtures where pressure plays a significant role, which the activity coefficient approach is unsuitable: y_{i}\\hat{\\phi}_{i}^{V} = x_{i}\\hat{\\phi}_{i}^{L} \\tag{15} where \\hat{\\phi}_{i}^{V} is the fugacity coefficient of the vapor phase and \\hat{\\phi}_{i}^{L} is the fugacity coefficient of the liquid phase, both for component i in the mixture. The fugacity coefficient is calculated using equations of state (EoS) in conjunction with mixing rules. Some examples are described in the Theory section of this documentation, such as the cubic equations of state and the COSMO-SAC-Phi model. Phase Diagrams and Degrees of Freedom To solve the system of equations formed by either modeling approach, it is necessary to determine the number of degrees of freedom using the Gibbs Phase Rule : F = C - P + 2 \\tag{16} where F is the number of degrees of freedom, C is the number of components, and P is the number of phases. For a binary system ( C=2 ) with two phases in equilibrium ( P=2 ), F is equal to 2. This means that two variables (e.g., temperature and pressure) must be specified to determine all other properties of the system. The results obtained from solving the system of equations formed by Equations 13 or 15 are often presented in Pxy and Txy diagrams of binary systems. The procedure for solving these equations is described in the Algorithm section. Pxy Diagram In the Pxy diagram shown in the figure below, pressure is plotted against the mole fraction of the liquid and vapor phases (x and y) at a constant temperature. The Bubble Point Curve (Px curve) is the upper curve at the diagram. Any point of this curve represents the saturated liquid, where the first bubble of vapor is formed. Above this curve, only the liquid phase exists. The Dew Point Curve (Py curve) is the lower curve of the diagram. At any point on this line, the vapor is saturated, where the first drop of liquid is formed. Below this curve, only the vapor phase exists. The Two-Phase Region occurs between the two curves, where the liquid and vapor phases coexist in equilibrium. Pxy diagram of cyclohexane(1)/sec-butanol(2). Squares are experimental data at 323.15 K; black line is the COSMO-SAC model. Txy Diagram In the Txy diagram shown below, temperature is plotted against composition at a constant pressure. Similarly, the Bubble Point Curve (Tx curve) is the lower curve, and for a given liquid composition it shows the temperature at which the first bubble of vapor forms upon heating. Below this curve, only liquid exists. The Dew Point Curve (Ty curve) is the upper curve, which represents the temperature where the last drop of liquid vaporizes. Above this curve, only vapor exists. Again, The Two-Phase Region occurs between the curves, where liquid and vapor coexist in equilibrium. Txy diagram of ethanol(1)/water(2). Squares are experimental data at 1.01 bar; black line is the COSMO-SAC model. Azeotropes In real mixtures, azeotropes are frequently observed, which occur when the bubble point and dew point curves touch, as shown in the Pxy diagram. At this point, the composition of the liquid phase is equal to the composition of the vapor phase (x_i = y_i) . In the Pxy diagram, an Maximum Pressure Azeotrope (Minimum-Boiling Azeotrope) can occur when the Px and Py curves meet at a maximum pressure. This happens when the interactions between unlike molecules are weaker than those between like molecules. Thus, the components prefer to be in their pure state, making the mixture more volatile than the pure components, resulting in a higher vapor pressure and a lower boiling point. Likewise, a Minimum Pressure Azeotrope (Maximum-Boiling Azeotrope) can happen when the curves meet at a minimum pressure. This signifies that the interactions between unlike molecules are stronger than those between like molecules. Consequently, the components prefer to be mixed, making the mixture harder to vaporize than the pure components. This results in a lower vapor pressure and a higher boiling point, requiring more energy to vaporize the mixture: Algorithm This section is currently under development and will be available soon. Stay tuned for updates! Practical Example The main model should be selected in the dropdown list shown in the figure below. The model\u2019s default options are displayed under the references links, with values of the universal parameters and different options of combinatorial terms. JCOSMO currently supports only binary VLE systems. However, the Mixture tab allows users to view activity coefficients for mixtures with n compounds. This data can be extracted via a Python script, and phase equilibria can then be solved externally. This advanced use case is further explained in Python Interface section. For a binary system, you can directly search for the two compounds and add them to the system, as illustrated in the figure below. The search engine uses compound names; if the desired compound is not found, try using alternative synonyms. The first selected compound is represented by the subscript 1 , and the second by 2 in all calculated properties. Before starting the VLE calculations, press the \u201cEdit\u2026\u201d button and carefully review the properties of each compound. If critical properties are missing, they should be added if a cubic equation of state is going to be used. The saturation pressure is required if an activity coefficient model is selected, according to the Modified Raoult\u2019s Law in the Theory concepts section. By pressing the \u201cEdit\u2026\u201d button, the user can choose the best available correlation. Coefficients are provided just for the default option; if another type is selected, the user must manually enter the new coefficients. Information about each property and correlation is available at the bottom section of the window. After making the necessary changes, confirm by clicking the \u201cOK\u201d button. The figure below illustrates the process of editing compounds and their properties: The next step is to compute the VLE. First, select the VLE tab in the upper-right corner of the JCOSMO window. The user can select the desired type of diagram, isobaric or isothermal, by clicking in the dropdown menu. The field on the right corresponds to either the temperature or pressure, depending on the selected diagram type, and can be adjusted by the user. The temperature must be provided in Kelvin and the pressure in bar. The next fields are the start and end value of composition. When the cursor is placed over any of these fields, a tooltip will appear indicating the required property and its unit. The \u201cUse SCMR\u201d option enables the user to apply this mixing rule, which combines an activity coefficient model with an equation of state. Currently, only the SRK-MC equation of state is available for this option. For more information, refer to the \u201cCubic Equations and Mixing Rules\u201d section under the Theory tab. The next dropdown menus are used to select more models to compare with the main model. Ensure that all required properties are included for each model. Finally, press the \u201cRecalc\u201d button to compute the VLE. The figure below illustrates this process in the JCOSMO GUI. If you want to save the chart you can press the \u201cExport to PDF\u201d button, which will save a PDF file in the \u2026\\jcosmo3\\pdf directory. Alternatively, you can right click with the mouse and copy the chart. The \u201cCopy to clipboard\u201d option will save the calculations, which can be pasted in an Excel file. The caption box location can be changed in the dropdown menu at the bottom of the window. For more details about binary charts and all options, see the \u201cBinary Mixture Charts\u201d section under Use cases in this documentation. The comparison of experimental data with the calculated results is also available. This requires creating a .txt file following the template shown in the figure below. The hash symbol (#) is used for comments. Initially write the first and second components, from left to right, with the exact same name as found in the interface. Then, add a header with temperature (T), pressure (P), molar liquid composition (X), and molar vapor composition (Y). If the letter W is used instead of X, mass fractions are assumed for the liquid phase\u2014this is especially useful for polymers. Right after the property, include its respective unit. Other temperature units can be used, but never use the degree symbol (\u00b0) or it will cause errors. Same for pressure, several units can be used \u2013 atm, mmHg, bar, psi, BTU. If data for one of the phases is missing, entering -1 will indicate its absence. After building the .txt file, you can simply load it into the program by clicking the \u201cExperiment\u2026\u201d button on the VLE tab, as shown below: Milo D. Koretsky.

This is done for mixtures where pressure plays a significant role, which the activity coefficient approach is unsuitable: y_{i}\\hat{\\phi}_{i}^{V} = x_{i}\\hat{\\phi}_{i}^{L} \\tag{15} where \\hat{\\phi}_{i}^{V} is the fugacity coefficient of the vapor phase and \\hat{\\phi}_{i}^{L} is the fugacity coefficient of the liquid phase, both for component i in the mixture. The fugacity coefficient is calculated using equations of state (EoS) in conjunction with mixing rules. Some examples are described in the Theory section of this documentation, such as the cubic equations of state and the COSMO-SAC-Phi model.","title":"2. Phi-Phi Method"},{"location":"vle/#phase-diagrams-and-degrees-of-freedom","text":"To solve the system of equations formed by either modeling approach, it is necessary to determine the number of degrees of freedom using the Gibbs Phase Rule : F = C - P + 2 \\tag{16} where F is the number of degrees of freedom, C is the number of components, and P is the number of phases. For a binary system ( C=2 ) with two phases in equilibrium ( P=2 ), F is equal to 2. This means that two variables (e.g., temperature and pressure) must be specified to determine all other properties of the system. The results obtained from solving the system of equations formed by Equations 13 or 15 are often presented in Pxy and Txy diagrams of binary systems. The procedure for solving these equations is described in the Algorithm section.","title":"Phase Diagrams and Degrees of Freedom"},{"location":"vle/#pxy-diagram","text":"In the Pxy diagram shown in the figure below, pressure is plotted against the mole fraction of the liquid and vapor phases (x and y) at a constant temperature. The Bubble Point Curve (Px curve) is the upper curve at the diagram. Any point of this curve represents the saturated liquid, where the first bubble of vapor is formed. Above this curve, only the liquid phase exists. The Dew Point Curve (Py curve) is the lower curve of the diagram. At any point on this line, the vapor is saturated, where the first drop of liquid is formed. Below this curve, only the vapor phase exists. The Two-Phase Region occurs between the two curves, where the liquid and vapor phases coexist in equilibrium. Pxy diagram of cyclohexane(1)/sec-butanol(2). Squares are experimental data at 323.15 K; black line is the COSMO-SAC model.","title":"Pxy Diagram"},{"location":"vle/#txy-diagram","text":"In the Txy diagram shown below, temperature is plotted against composition at a constant pressure. Similarly, the Bubble Point Curve (Tx curve) is the lower curve, and for a given liquid composition it shows the temperature at which the first bubble of vapor forms upon heating. Below this curve, only liquid exists. The Dew Point Curve (Ty curve) is the upper curve, which represents the temperature where the last drop of liquid vaporizes. Above this curve, only vapor exists. Again, The Two-Phase Region occurs between the curves, where liquid and vapor coexist in equilibrium. Txy diagram of ethanol(1)/water(2). Squares are experimental data at 1.01 bar; black line is the COSMO-SAC model.","title":"Txy Diagram"},{"location":"vle/#azeotropes","text":"In real mixtures, azeotropes are frequently observed, which occur when the bubble point and dew point curves touch, as shown in the Pxy diagram. At this point, the composition of the liquid phase is equal to the composition of the vapor phase (x_i = y_i) . In the Pxy diagram, an Maximum Pressure Azeotrope (Minimum-Boiling Azeotrope) can occur when the Px and Py curves meet at a maximum pressure. This happens when the interactions between unlike molecules are weaker than those between like molecules. Thus, the components prefer to be in their pure state, making the mixture more volatile than the pure components, resulting in a higher vapor pressure and a lower boiling point. Likewise, a Minimum Pressure Azeotrope (Maximum-Boiling Azeotrope) can happen when the curves meet at a minimum pressure. This signifies that the interactions between unlike molecules are stronger than those between like molecules. Consequently, the components prefer to be mixed, making the mixture harder to vaporize than the pure components. This results in a lower vapor pressure and a higher boiling point, requiring more energy to vaporize the mixture:","title":"Azeotropes"},{"location":"vle/#algorithm","text":"This section is currently under development and will be available soon. Stay tuned for updates!","title":"Algorithm"},{"location":"vle/#practical-example","text":"The main model should be selected in the dropdown list shown in the figure below. The model\u2019s default options are displayed under the references links, with values of the universal parameters and different options of combinatorial terms. JCOSMO currently supports only binary VLE systems. However, the Mixture tab allows users to view activity coefficients for mixtures with n compounds. This data can be extracted via a Python script, and phase equilibria can then be solved externally. This advanced use case is further explained in Python Interface section. For a binary system, you can directly search for the two compounds and add them to the system, as illustrated in the figure below. The search engine uses compound names; if the desired compound is not found, try using alternative synonyms. The first selected compound is represented by the subscript 1 , and the second by 2 in all calculated properties. Before starting the VLE calculations, press the \u201cEdit\u2026\u201d button and carefully review the properties of each compound. If critical properties are missing, they should be added if a cubic equation of state is going to be used. The saturation pressure is required if an activity coefficient model is selected, according to the Modified Raoult\u2019s Law in the Theory concepts section. By pressing the \u201cEdit\u2026\u201d button, the user can choose the best available correlation. Coefficients are provided just for the default option; if another type is selected, the user must manually enter the new coefficients. Information about each property and correlation is available at the bottom section of the window. After making the necessary changes, confirm by clicking the \u201cOK\u201d button. The figure below illustrates the process of editing compounds and their properties: The next step is to compute the VLE. First, select the VLE tab in the upper-right corner of the JCOSMO window. The user can select the desired type of diagram, isobaric or isothermal, by clicking in the dropdown menu. The field on the right corresponds to either the temperature or pressure, depending on the selected diagram type, and can be adjusted by the user. The temperature must be provided in Kelvin and the pressure in bar. The next fields are the start and end value of composition. When the cursor is placed over any of these fields, a tooltip will appear indicating the required property and its unit. The \u201cUse SCMR\u201d option enables the user to apply this mixing rule, which combines an activity coefficient model with an equation of state. Currently, only the SRK-MC equation of state is available for this option. For more information, refer to the \u201cCubic Equations and Mixing Rules\u201d section under the Theory tab. The next dropdown menus are used to select more models to compare with the main model. Ensure that all required properties are included for each model. Finally, press the \u201cRecalc\u201d button to compute the VLE. The figure below illustrates this process in the JCOSMO GUI. If you want to save the chart you can press the \u201cExport to PDF\u201d button, which will save a PDF file in the \u2026\\jcosmo3\\pdf directory. Alternatively, you can right click with the mouse and copy the chart. The \u201cCopy to clipboard\u201d option will save the calculations, which can be pasted in an Excel file. The caption box location can be changed in the dropdown menu at the bottom of the window. For more details about binary charts and all options, see the \u201cBinary Mixture Charts\u201d section under Use cases in this documentation. The comparison of experimental data with the calculated results is also available. This requires creating a .txt file following the template shown in the figure below. The hash symbol (#) is used for comments. Initially write the first and second components, from left to right, with the exact same name as found in the interface. Then, add a header with temperature (T), pressure (P), molar liquid composition (X), and molar vapor composition (Y). If the letter W is used instead of X, mass fractions are assumed for the liquid phase\u2014this is especially useful for polymers. Right after the property, include its respective unit. Other temperature units can be used, but never use the degree symbol (\u00b0) or it will cause errors. Same for pressure, several units can be used \u2013 atm, mmHg, bar, psi, BTU. If data for one of the phases is missing, entering -1 will indicate its absence. After building the .txt file, you can simply load it into the program by clicking the \u201cExperiment\u2026\u201d button on the VLE tab, as shown below: Milo D. Koretsky.
