We will also delve into semi-empirical approximations of the theory, including well-known models like Wilson, NRTL, UNIQUAC, and others. These models have been pivotal in advancing our understanding of solution thermodynamics and play a key role in various applications, including phase equilibria and mixture property prediction. Original quasi-chemical model The quasi-chemical model was pioneered by Guggenheim 1 in 1940s as a thermodynamic model to describe the non-random arrangement of molecules in a mixture, particularly in liquids. In its original version, it is based on a lattice picture of the liquid state assuming interactions only between nearest neighbour compounds. In this framework, interactions can be interpreted as chemical reactions at equilibrium. For a binary mixture of compounds A and B , the following reaction holds: AA + BB \\rightleftharpoons 2 AB When either compound A or compound B is pure, they can only interact with other identical molecules, forming AA or BB pairs. However, in mixtures, there exists an equilibrium between AA , BB , and AB complexes. Using the notation introduced by Soares and Staudt 2 , there should be Boltzmann factor \\Psi_{AB} in terms of the pair formation (or interaction) energy u_{AB} = u_{BA} , given by: \\Psi_{AB} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u_{AB}}{kT}\\right) Then, the probability of finding AB pairs would be given by: \\theta_{AB}^2 = \\theta_{AA} \\theta_{BB} \\frac{\\Psi_{AB}^2}{\\Psi_{AA} \\Psi_{BB}} Note: The above equation is equivalent to the quasi-chemical treatment, Eq.(4.09.1) of Guggenheim 1 . If the mixture where to be completely random: $\\theta_{AB} = \\Theta_{A} \\Theta_{B}\\$), where \\($\\Theta_{A}$ is the surface area fraction of compound A in mixture. Extensions in terms of groups or small segments In its original and simplest form, the quasi-chemical method is expressed in molecular terms, which imposes several limitations on the model. For instance, the model is unable to describe positive excess entropies (found for instance in the acetone/ n -heptane system). The simple preference for cross-compound interactions invariably leads to an increase in order within the mixture 3 . In a more sophisticated form (assuming the presence of functional groups with different interaction energies), quasi-chemical models become quite flexible. However, expressing the problem in terms of groups results in an expanded set of equations that need to be solved. Notably, Panayiotou 4 have already presented a formulation in terms of surface area fractions in the 1980s and shortly after Larsen 5 investigated the numerical solution of the resulting system of equations. The surface fragmentation can be further refined to small surface segments , as depicted below 2 : This refinement results in sets of equations equivalent to those used in COSMO-RS 6 or COSMO-SAC 7 models. Many studies have recognized COSMO-based models as equivalent to the quasi-chemical treatment 8 6 9 10 2 . Elliott 11 extends this concept by characterizing COSMO-RS/SAC models as Small Segment Quasi-Chemical Theory (SS-QCT), considering them essentially equivalent , despite the absence of an explicit lattice reference. We prefer to refer to this category of models simply as modern quasi-chemical models. Semi-empirical approximations When no additional approximations are assumed, quasi-chemical models lack explicit expressions for activity coefficients, requiring the solution of a set of non-linear equations 5 . Many semi-empirical developments - like Wilson 12 , NRTL 13 , and UNIQUAC 14 - originate from quasi-chemical theory, but their simplifications allow for explicit expressions for the activity coefficients 5 . These models became widely used due to their simplicity and flexibility 3 . UNIFAC (UNIQUAC Functional-group Activity Coefficients) original 15 and modified versions like the UNIFAC (Do) 16 are still usually very good options when one needs to predict activity coefficients.

We will also discuss the incorporation of mixing rules, both classical and advanced, which allow these equations to be applied to multicomponent systems. Cubic equations of state To define the thermodynamic state of a pure substance in a single phase, two thermodynamic properties are required. An equation of state provides a mathematical relationship that allows the determination of an unknown property from two known variables. This requires mathematical relations that are functions of temperature ( T ), pressure ( P ), and specific volume ( v ), which are intensive properties that can be determined experimentally 1 . There are numerous forms of equations of state in the literature, and the most commonly employed are the cubic equations of state . These are third-degree polynomial equations in volume, whose roots can be obtained through various solution methods. A key advantage is that they always yield three roots, allowing for a predictable number of possible solutions 2 . In 1873, van der Waals 3 attempted to overcome the limitations of the ideal gas law, which neglects intermolecular forces and assumes that gas molecules occupy negligible volume. He proposed that gas molecules possess finite volume at high pressures and introduced a covolume parameter, b , subtracted from the molar volume. To account for molecular interactions, he included the term a/v^2 , where a represents attractive forces between molecules. The resulting expression is: P(T, v) = \\frac{RT}{v - b} - \\frac{a}{v^2} Here, a and b are parameters determined from critical point data for pure substances. The parameter b represents the molar volume limit as P \\rightarrow \\infty, and v \\rightarrow b 3 . Based on his work, Redlich and Kwong 4 observed that the a/v^2 term did not account for the influence of temperature on attractive molecular forces. Thus, they introduced a temperature dependency in the attractive term: P(T, v) = \\frac{RT}{v - b} - \\frac{a / \\sqrt{T}}{v(v + b)} This modification provided a better representation of several systems. However, as the parameter a remained constant, Soave 5 proposed a widely used modification, known as SRK (Soave\u2013Redlich\u2013Kwong), where a is replaced with a temperature-dependent function \\alpha : \\alpha(T_r, \\omega) = \\left[ 1 + (0.480 + 1.574 \\omega - 0.176 \\omega^2)(1 - \\sqrt{T_r}) \\right]^2 Here, \\omega is the acentric factor, and T_r = T/T_c is the reduced temperature, with T_c being the critical temperature and T the system temperature. Peng and Robinson 6 evaluated the SRK model for hydrocarbon systems and found it needed improvements, particularly for liquid densities near the critical point. They proposed the following modified expression, altering the volume dependence in the attractive term: P = \\frac{RT}{v - b} - \\frac{a \\alpha}{v(v + b) + b(v - b)} The terms a , b , and \\alpha(T) have the same interpretations as in the SRK model. The \\alpha(T) function was redefined as: \\alpha(T_r, \\omega) = \\left[ 1 + (0.37464 + 1.54226 \\omega - 0.26992 \\omega^2)(1 - \\sqrt{T_r}) \\right]^2 These equations of state are widely implemented in computational tools and offer reasonable estimates for thermodynamic properties. Nevertheless, they do not accurately represent all substances and mixtures. As a result, many modifications have been developed over time to better describe the behavior of diverse systems. Mathias and Copeman 7 developed an alpha funcition that is a modification designed to enhance the accuracy of PR and SRK equations in predicting fluid phase behavior. The standard alpha functions within these equations can sometimes produce inaccuracies, particularly when dealing with complex mixtures or a wide range of thermodynamic conditions. The Mathias-Copeman alpha function addresses these limitations by introducing additional adjustable parameters ( c_1 , c_2 , and c_3 ), thereby providing a more flexible and accurate representation of this temperature dependence. This increased flexibility allows for a better fit to experimental data, improving the equation's ability to model a broader range of substances and conditions. In essence, it acts as a replacement for the original alpha function within these equations, offering a refined approach to modeling the temperature-dependent behavior of fluids. This function is implemented in JCOSMO with the SRK model (SRK-MC). \\alpha_\\text{MC}\\left(T_r\\right)=\\left[1+c_1\\left(1-\\sqrt{T_r}\\right)+c_2\\left(1-\\sqrt{T_r}\\right)^2+c_3\\left(1-\\sqrt{T_r}\\right)^3\\right]^2 A general form of a cubic equation of state is expressed as: P(T, v) = \\frac{RT}{v - b} - \\frac{a(T)}{(v + \\epsilon b)(v + \\sigma b)} Where \\epsilon and \\sigma are constants specific to the equation of state used. The parameters a(T) and b are defined as: \\begin{aligned} a(T) &= \\Psi \\frac{\\alpha(T_r, \\omega) R^2 T_c^2}{P_c} \\\\ b &= \\Omega \\frac{RT_c}{P_c} \\end{aligned} The values of \\Psi , \\Omega , and \\alpha(T_r, \\omega) vary depending on the specific equation of state, as shown below. The subscript c refers to the critical point properties. The acentric factor \\omega is defined as 8 : \\omega = -1 - \\log \\left[ \\frac{P^{\\text{sat}}(T_r = 0.7)}{P_c} \\right] Where P^{\\text{sat}}(T_r = 0.7) is the saturation pressure at a reduced temperature of 0.7 T_r = 0.7 .

This is necessary because, for cubic equations of state, the parameters a and b for mixtures cannot be obtained directly as they are for pure compounds, where critical property data are used. Therefore, mixing rules establish mathematical relationships that relate the mixture parameters a and b to the parameters a_i and b_i of each pure component i . The classic van der Waals mixing rule consists of a linear relation for the covolume b and a quadratic rule for the attractive parameter a : \\begin{gathered} a = \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} x_{i} x_{j} a_{ij} \\\\ b = \\sum_{i} x_{i} b_{i} \\end{gathered} where a is the mixture's attractive parameter, b is the mixture's covolume, x_i is the mole fraction of component i , b_i is the covolume of species i , and a_{ij} includes both pure component parameters (when i = j ) and interaction parameters (when i \\neq j ). The interaction parameters a_{ij} are calculated using the following combination rule based on a geometric mean: a_{ij} = \\sqrt{a_i a_j}(1 - k_{ij}) Here, k_{ij} is the binary interaction parameter between components i and j , typically fitted using experimental phase equilibrium data. While these parameters are often assumed to be zero, they are crucial for mixtures with significant deviations from ideality. Nevertheless, even with k_{ij} , these classical rules struggle to represent mixtures involving strong molecular interactions, such as polar mixtures (e.g., water and ethanol), due to the absence of temperature-dependent binary parameters 9 . Huron and Vidal 10 in 1979 proposed a mixing rule based on excess Gibbs energy models g^E_\\gamma . They equated the excess Gibbs energy calculated using a cubic equation of state g^E_\\phi , at the limit P \\rightarrow \\infty , to the expression for g^E_\\gamma . Under this pressure condition, the molar volume is considered equal to the covolume b , and the expression for the a parameter is derived. Following the work of Huron and Vidal 10 , several other mixing rules were developed, including MHV-1 (Modified Huron-Vidal mixing rule) 11 12 , UMR (Universal Mixing Rule) 13 , the rule by Wong and Sandler 14 , and PSRK (Predictive Soave-Redlich-Kwong) 15 . The PSRK (Predictive Soave-Redlich-Kwong) 15 combines the SRK equation with the \\alpha(T) function proposed by Mathias and Copeman shown previously, and the UNIFAC model. To combine the SRK equation of state with the excess Gibbs energy model (UNIFAC), the MHV1 mixing rule was applied: \\begin{gathered} a = b \\left[\\frac{g_0^E}{A_1} + \\sum_i x_i \\frac{a_i}{b_i} + \\frac{RT}{A_1} \\sum_i x_i \\ln \\frac{b}{b_i}\\right] \\\\ b = \\sum_i x_i b_i \\end{gathered} where g_0^E is the excess Gibbs energy in the limit P \\rightarrow 0 , calculated using the UNIFAC model. In PSRK, the parameter A_1 is set to -0.64663. The UNIFAC parameter matrix used in PSRK includes six additional gases, and the most recent revision accepted by the UNIFAC consortium was presented by Horstmann in 2005 16 . However, all these mixing rules introduce distortions in phase equilibrium calculations at low pressures due to discrepancies between g^E_\\phi and g^E_\\gamma under such conditions. Nonetheless, they provide satisfactory results for many mixtures with significant non-ideality, representing an improvement over the classical van der Waals rule. To overcome this limitation, Staudt and coworkers 17 developed a mixing rule that yields consistent results, where the excess Gibbs energy g^E_\\phi from the equation of state matches the excess Gibbs energy g^E_\\gamma from the activity coefficient model. Due to this consistency, regardless of the cubic equation of state used, the authors named the approach the SCMR (Self-Consistent Mixing Rule). This mixing rule was created by developers of JCOSMO, and it is implemented as an option when calculating phase equilibria. In this mixing rule, the following expression is used to calculate the excess Gibbs energy via an equation of state: \\frac{g^E_\\phi}{RT} = \\ln \\hat{\\phi} - \\sum_i x_i \\ln \\phi_i where \\hat{\\phi} is the fugacity coefficient of the mixture, and \\phi_i is the fugacity coefficient of the pure component i , both at the same temperature and pressure. From this equation, the authors made some assumptions, the main one being that excess volume is negligible. Consequently, they derived the following expression: q = \\frac{1}{I^{Id}} \\left( \\frac{g^E_\\gamma}{RT} - \\sum_i x_i \\ln \\left( \\frac{v_i - b_i}{v^{Id} - b} \\right) + \\sum_i x_i q_i I_i \\right) Here, the superscript Id denotes the ideal solution reference, the subscript i refers to each component, v is the molar volume, and q and I are defined as follows: \\begin{aligned} q_i &\\equiv \\frac{a_i}{b_i RT} \\\\ I_i &\\equiv I_0 \\ln \\left( \\frac{v_i + \\epsilon b_i}{v_i + \\sigma b_i} \\right) \\\\ I_0 &= \\frac{1}{\\sigma - \\epsilon} \\end{aligned} where \\epsilon and \\sigma are constants that depend on the chosen equation of state, as shown in the previous table.

We will also discuss the incorporation of mixing rules, both classical and advanced, which allow these equations to be applied to multicomponent systems.","title":"Cubic equations of state and mixing rules"},{"location":"cubic/#cubic-equations-of-state","text":"To define the thermodynamic state of a pure substance in a single phase, two thermodynamic properties are required. An equation of state provides a mathematical relationship that allows the determination of an unknown property from two known variables. This requires mathematical relations that are functions of temperature ( T ), pressure ( P ), and specific volume ( v ), which are intensive properties that can be determined experimentally 1 . There are numerous forms of equations of state in the literature, and the most commonly employed are the cubic equations of state . These are third-degree polynomial equations in volume, whose roots can be obtained through various solution methods. A key advantage is that they always yield three roots, allowing for a predictable number of possible solutions 2 . In 1873, van der Waals 3 attempted to overcome the limitations of the ideal gas law, which neglects intermolecular forces and assumes that gas molecules occupy negligible volume. He proposed that gas molecules possess finite volume at high pressures and introduced a covolume parameter, b , subtracted from the molar volume. To account for molecular interactions, he included the term a/v^2 , where a represents attractive forces between molecules. The resulting expression is: P(T, v) = \\frac{RT}{v - b} - \\frac{a}{v^2} Here, a and b are parameters determined from critical point data for pure substances. The parameter b represents the molar volume limit as P \\rightarrow \\infty, and v \\rightarrow b 3 . Based on his work, Redlich and Kwong 4 observed that the a/v^2 term did not account for the influence of temperature on attractive molecular forces. Thus, they introduced a temperature dependency in the attractive term: P(T, v) = \\frac{RT}{v - b} - \\frac{a / \\sqrt{T}}{v(v + b)} This modification provided a better representation of several systems. However, as the parameter a remained constant, Soave 5 proposed a widely used modification, known as SRK (Soave\u2013Redlich\u2013Kwong), where a is replaced with a temperature-dependent function \\alpha : \\alpha(T_r, \\omega) = \\left[ 1 + (0.480 + 1.574 \\omega - 0.176 \\omega^2)(1 - \\sqrt{T_r}) \\right]^2 Here, \\omega is the acentric factor, and T_r = T/T_c is the reduced temperature, with T_c being the critical temperature and T the system temperature. Peng and Robinson 6 evaluated the SRK model for hydrocarbon systems and found it needed improvements, particularly for liquid densities near the critical point. They proposed the following modified expression, altering the volume dependence in the attractive term: P = \\frac{RT}{v - b} - \\frac{a \\alpha}{v(v + b) + b(v - b)} The terms a , b , and \\alpha(T) have the same interpretations as in the SRK model. The \\alpha(T) function was redefined as: \\alpha(T_r, \\omega) = \\left[ 1 + (0.37464 + 1.54226 \\omega - 0.26992 \\omega^2)(1 - \\sqrt{T_r}) \\right]^2 These equations of state are widely implemented in computational tools and offer reasonable estimates for thermodynamic properties. Nevertheless, they do not accurately represent all substances and mixtures. As a result, many modifications have been developed over time to better describe the behavior of diverse systems. Mathias and Copeman 7 developed an alpha funcition that is a modification designed to enhance the accuracy of PR and SRK equations in predicting fluid phase behavior. The standard alpha functions within these equations can sometimes produce inaccuracies, particularly when dealing with complex mixtures or a wide range of thermodynamic conditions. The Mathias-Copeman alpha function addresses these limitations by introducing additional adjustable parameters ( c_1 , c_2 , and c_3 ), thereby providing a more flexible and accurate representation of this temperature dependence. This increased flexibility allows for a better fit to experimental data, improving the equation's ability to model a broader range of substances and conditions. In essence, it acts as a replacement for the original alpha function within these equations, offering a refined approach to modeling the temperature-dependent behavior of fluids. This function is implemented in JCOSMO with the SRK model (SRK-MC). \\alpha_\\text{MC}\\left(T_r\\right)=\\left[1+c_1\\left(1-\\sqrt{T_r}\\right)+c_2\\left(1-\\sqrt{T_r}\\right)^2+c_3\\left(1-\\sqrt{T_r}\\right)^3\\right]^2 A general form of a cubic equation of state is expressed as: P(T, v) = \\frac{RT}{v - b} - \\frac{a(T)}{(v + \\epsilon b)(v + \\sigma b)} Where \\epsilon and \\sigma are constants specific to the equation of state used.

This is necessary because, for cubic equations of state, the parameters a and b for mixtures cannot be obtained directly as they are for pure compounds, where critical property data are used. Therefore, mixing rules establish mathematical relationships that relate the mixture parameters a and b to the parameters a_i and b_i of each pure component i . The classic van der Waals mixing rule consists of a linear relation for the covolume b and a quadratic rule for the attractive parameter a : \\begin{gathered} a = \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} x_{i} x_{j} a_{ij} \\\\ b = \\sum_{i} x_{i} b_{i} \\end{gathered} where a is the mixture's attractive parameter, b is the mixture's covolume, x_i is the mole fraction of component i , b_i is the covolume of species i , and a_{ij} includes both pure component parameters (when i = j ) and interaction parameters (when i \\neq j ). The interaction parameters a_{ij} are calculated using the following combination rule based on a geometric mean: a_{ij} = \\sqrt{a_i a_j}(1 - k_{ij}) Here, k_{ij} is the binary interaction parameter between components i and j , typically fitted using experimental phase equilibrium data. While these parameters are often assumed to be zero, they are crucial for mixtures with significant deviations from ideality. Nevertheless, even with k_{ij} , these classical rules struggle to represent mixtures involving strong molecular interactions, such as polar mixtures (e.g., water and ethanol), due to the absence of temperature-dependent binary parameters 9 . Huron and Vidal 10 in 1979 proposed a mixing rule based on excess Gibbs energy models g^E_\\gamma . They equated the excess Gibbs energy calculated using a cubic equation of state g^E_\\phi , at the limit P \\rightarrow \\infty , to the expression for g^E_\\gamma . Under this pressure condition, the molar volume is considered equal to the covolume b , and the expression for the a parameter is derived. Following the work of Huron and Vidal 10 , several other mixing rules were developed, including MHV-1 (Modified Huron-Vidal mixing rule) 11 12 , UMR (Universal Mixing Rule) 13 , the rule by Wong and Sandler 14 , and PSRK (Predictive Soave-Redlich-Kwong) 15 . The PSRK (Predictive Soave-Redlich-Kwong) 15 combines the SRK equation with the \\alpha(T) function proposed by Mathias and Copeman shown previously, and the UNIFAC model. To combine the SRK equation of state with the excess Gibbs energy model (UNIFAC), the MHV1 mixing rule was applied: \\begin{gathered} a = b \\left[\\frac{g_0^E}{A_1} + \\sum_i x_i \\frac{a_i}{b_i} + \\frac{RT}{A_1} \\sum_i x_i \\ln \\frac{b}{b_i}\\right] \\\\ b = \\sum_i x_i b_i \\end{gathered} where g_0^E is the excess Gibbs energy in the limit P \\rightarrow 0 , calculated using the UNIFAC model. In PSRK, the parameter A_1 is set to -0.64663. The UNIFAC parameter matrix used in PSRK includes six additional gases, and the most recent revision accepted by the UNIFAC consortium was presented by Horstmann in 2005 16 . However, all these mixing rules introduce distortions in phase equilibrium calculations at low pressures due to discrepancies between g^E_\\phi and g^E_\\gamma under such conditions. Nonetheless, they provide satisfactory results for many mixtures with significant non-ideality, representing an improvement over the classical van der Waals rule. To overcome this limitation, Staudt and coworkers 17 developed a mixing rule that yields consistent results, where the excess Gibbs energy g^E_\\phi from the equation of state matches the excess Gibbs energy g^E_\\gamma from the activity coefficient model. Due to this consistency, regardless of the cubic equation of state used, the authors named the approach the SCMR (Self-Consistent Mixing Rule). This mixing rule was created by developers of JCOSMO, and it is implemented as an option when calculating phase equilibria. In this mixing rule, the following expression is used to calculate the excess Gibbs energy via an equation of state: \\frac{g^E_\\phi}{RT} = \\ln \\hat{\\phi} - \\sum_i x_i \\ln \\phi_i where \\hat{\\phi} is the fugacity coefficient of the mixture, and \\phi_i is the fugacity coefficient of the pure component i , both at the same temperature and pressure. From this equation, the authors made some assumptions, the main one being that excess volume is negligible. Consequently, they derived the following expression: q = \\frac{1}{I^{Id}} \\left( \\frac{g^E_\\gamma}{RT} - \\sum_i x_i \\ln \\left( \\frac{v_i - b_i}{v^{Id} - b} \\right) + \\sum_i x_i q_i I_i \\right) Here, the superscript Id denotes the ideal solution reference, the subscript i refers to each component, v is the molar volume, and q and I are defined as follows: \\begin{aligned} q_i &\\equiv \\frac{a_i}{b_i RT} \\\\ I_i &\\equiv I_0 \\ln \\left( \\frac{v_i + \\epsilon b_i}{v_i + \\sigma b_i} \\right) \\\\ I_0 &= \\frac{1}{\\sigma - \\epsilon} \\end{aligned} where \\epsilon and \\sigma are constants that depend on the chosen equation of state, as shown in the previous table.

This section provides a quick overview to help you get started with JCOSMO and make the most of its powerful modeling capabilities. Check how to search for compounds , view sigma surfaces and profiles , and predict activity coefficients, VLE, and more. Follow the steps in this guide to quickly familiarize yourself with these features and start using JCOSMO effectively for your simulations and analysis. Search and select compounds You can search the database by entering part of a compound's name and hitting ENTER or clicking Search . Once found, select the desired compound and use the Add button or hit ENTER again. The selected compounds are used it in the calculations available in JCOSMO . View sigma-surfaces Once you have selected one or more molecules, you can view the sigma-surfaces by clicking the View Surfaces button: For each compound, the COSMO 3D surface of induced charge densities (sigma-surface) is shown. The standard color convention is: green for neutral (apolar) regions, red for induced positive charges, and blue for induced negative charges. These induced charges arise due to differences in electronegativity between atoms within a molecule. For example, oxygen is highly electronegative and tends to attract electron density, inducing a positive charge (shown in red). Conversely, hydrogen atoms in polar bonds (such as O-H or N-H) tend to lose electron density and thus induce a negative charge (shown in blue) on themselves. This charge distribution is obtained using the COSMO method , which models the molecule as being embedded in a perfect conductor , similar to a liquid metal. This approximation allows the calculation of charge polarization at the molecular surface, leading to the sigma-surface representation. In addition to the sigma-surface, the compound's molecular volume, surface area, and molar mass are also displayed. Activity coefficients, Excess, and Mixture properties If exactly two compounds are selected, the Binary tab can be used to display the activity coefficient chart. Just click on Calculate and the logarithm of the activity coefficients chart is calculated. Recalling that when a compound is pure, \\ln \\gamma_i = 0 , and when its mole fraction tends to zero, we reach the infinite dilution limit: \\ln \\gamma_i = \\ln \\gamma_i^\\infty . The actual infinite dilution values are also displayed at the bottom of the page: When mixing cyclohexane and sec-butanol , the mixture shows positive deviations from ideality , meaning the logarithm of the activity coefficients are positive with the compounds thermodynamically uncomfortable in the mixture compared to their pure states. In this case, this behavior arises mainly from differences in molecular interactions . Sec-butanol molecules can form hydrogen bonds with each other. Introducing cyclohexane disrupts these interactions, reducing the stabilization provided by hydrogen bonding. The user can also play with the checkboxes at the top: ln Gamma : displays the logarithm of the activity coefficients (default) Excess : displays the mixture excess properties Mixture : displays the mixture properties, recalling excess Gibbs and Entropy differ from mixture Gibbs and Entropy Dimensionless (1/RT) : dimensionless (or divided by RT) properties are used (default), otherwise J/mol or J/g are used Mass based : Use mass-based calculations instead of the default molar basis Sigma profiles A sigma profile is a molecule-specific distribution of charge density across a solute's surface, used in COSMO-based models to describe intermolecular interactions. It represents the fraction of the surface area associated with a given screening charge density ( \\sigma ). Now, let's view a sigma profile in JCOSMO. Simply navigate to the Profile tab and click Refresh \u2014the profiles for all selected compounds will be displayed. Cyclohexane is a nonpolar molecule, meaning its sigma profile is concentrated around zero charge density . This indicates a surface largely free of significant electrostatic interactions, making cyclohexane a typical example of a neutral, nonpolar solvent in COSMO-based models. For sec-butanol , the presence of the hydroxyl (-OH) group introduces regions of polarization . The oxygen atom in the hydroxyl group tends to accumulate electron density , leading to induced positive charge densities on nearby surface segments. Conversely, the hydrogen of the hydroxyl group becomes electron-deficient , contributing to negative induced charge densities . However, despite these polar contributions, a substantial portion of sec-butanol\u2019s surface remains neutral , reflecting the balance between its hydrophobic alkyl chain and hydrophilic hydroxyl group . This difference in sigma profiles explains why cyclohexane cannot donate or accept hydrogen bonds, while sec-butanol can participate in hydrogen bonding while still retaining some nonpolar character. VLE \u2014 vapor-liquid equilibrium To predict an isothermal vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) , navigate to the VLE tab and click Recalc . This will generate the equilibrium data based on the selected model. Please note that two compounds must be selected before proceeding with the prediction. You can also compare the predictions with other models (e.g. UNIFAC (Do) ) by selecting it in the comparison combobox , as shown below: By default, the predictions are based on the assumption that modified Raoult's law holds: P y_i = x_i \\gamma_i P_i^{sat} In this system, the VLE exhibits positive deviations from ideal behavior, the activity coefficients are greater than one, reflecting the unfavorable interactions between the components. These interactions cause the components to escape into the vapor phase more readily, increasing the bubble pressure compared to an ideal mixture. Comparison with experimental data In addition to pure predictions, JCOSMO can also compare model responses with experimental data. To do this, simply select Experiment... and navigate to a text file containing the experimental data. JCOSMO includes a small selection of experimental data in its data folder: jcosmo3 \u251c\u2500\u2500 jcosmo.exe \u251c\u2500\u2500 jcosmo.sh \u251c\u2500\u2500 data \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 vle # Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 lle # Liquid-Liquid Equilibrium \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 sle # Solid-Liquid Equilibrium \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 ... \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... For the cyclohexane/sec-butanol system, experimental data is available for 323.15 K . When this experimental file is selected, the results shown above are displayed. For this particular case, both the selected COSMO-SAC variant and UNIFAC (Do) produce predictions that closely match the available experimental data, including the azeotrope. However, COSMO-based models , such as COSMO-SAC , offer several advantages over group contribution methods like UNIFAC . One key advantage is that COSMO-based models rely on information derived from quantum chemistry calculations. Unlike UNIFAC , which uses predefined group interactions that have to be calibrated with experimental data. Thus, COSMO-based models are less reliant on empirical data and can be applied to a broader range of systems, including those with limited or no group contributions. This makes COSMO-based models particularly useful for systems with complex interactions or for predicting properties of new, uncharacterized compounds. LLE \u2014 liquid-liquid equilibrium JCOSMO also provides a framework for predicting liquid-liquid equilibrium (LLE) , navigate to the LLE tab and click Recalc . Please note that two compounds must be selected before proceeding with the prediction. Additionally, LLE occurs when a binary or multicomponent liquid mixture separates into two immiscible liquid phases at equilibrium. This phase separation is mostly driven by differences in molecular interactions. However, not all binary mixtures will undergo phase separation. Some systems remain fully miscible across all compositions. In that case, no predictions will be made. If the Gibbs energy curve exhibits a double-well shape with a common tangent, the mixture is predicted to split into two liquid phases. In JCOSMO, the compositions of the two coexisting phases ( x^{\\alpha} and x^{\\beta} ) at the initial temperature point are determined using a dividing rectangles global search algorithm. If a valid two-phase system is identified for the selected mixture, subsequent calculations follow the isoactivity criterion for liquid phases \\alpha and \\beta : x_i^{\\alpha} \\gamma_i^{\\alpha} = x_i^{\\beta} \\gamma_i^{\\beta} As for VLEs, the user can perform either pure predictions by clicking on Recalc or compare the results with experimental data by selecting the Experiment... button. Results for the system n -pentanol/water are shown below: SLE \u2014 solid-liquid equilibrium JCOSMO can also perform solid-liquid equilibrium (SLE) calculations. The standard calculations assume a pure compound in the solid phase, surrounded by a liquid phase. Under this assumption, and with the further considerations that there is no phase transition and that the heat capacity difference between the solid and liquid phases is negligible, the following relation holds: x_i \\gamma_i = \\exp \\left( \\frac{ -\\Delta H_i^{\\text{fus}} \\left( 1 - \\frac{T}{T_i^{\\text{fus}}} \\right)}{ R T } \\right) where: x_i is the mole fraction of the solute in the liquid phase, \\gamma_i is the activity coefficient of the solute in the liquid phase, \\Delta H_i^{\\text{fus}} is the solute enthalpy of fusion, T_i^{\\text{fus}} is the solute fusion temperature, R is the universal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature. Note that JCOSMO can also predict SLE with up to two solid transition temperatures and with a non-zero heat capacity difference between solid and liquid. As usual, the user can perform either pure predictions by clicking on Recalc or compare the results with experimental data by selecting the Experiment... button.

UNIFAC Introduced in 1975 by Fredenslund et al. 1 , the UNIFAC model (UNIQUAC Functional-group Activity Coefficients) is a group-contribution method developed for predicting activity coefficients in nonelectrolyte liquid mixtures. In this approach, molecules are represented as assemblies of functional groups, with thermodynamic properties estimated as the sum of contributions from these individual groups. This method is particularly advantageous for mixture modeling, as it enables the reuse of group parameters across different compounds, expanding coverage of the chemical space while reducing the need for extensive experimental data. In UNIFAC, the molecular activity coefficient is made of two parts, one combinatorial and one residual: \\ln \\gamma_{i} = \\ln \\gamma_{i}^{C} + \\ln \\gamma_{i}^{R} Combinatorial : provides the contribution due to differences in molecular size and shape. Residual : provides the contribution due to molecular interactions. The combinatorial part is taken as the same as the one in UNIQUAC \u2013 designed in a group-contribution scope \u2013 without modification. \\ln \\gamma_{i}^{C} = \\ln\\frac{\\Phi_{i}}{x_{i}} + \\frac{z}{2}q_{i}\\ln\\frac{\\theta_{i}}{\\Phi_{i}} + l_{i} - \\frac{\\Phi_{i}}{x_{i}} \\sum_{j}x_{j}l_{j} l_{J} = \\frac{z}{2} \\left(r_{i} - q_{i} \\right) - \\left( r_{i} -1 \\right)_{i} z = 10 \\theta_{i} = \\frac{q_{i}x_{i}}{\\sum_{j}q_{j}x_{j}} \\Phi_{i} = \\frac{r_{i}x_{i}}{\\sum_{j}r_{j}x_{j}} r_{i} = \\sum_{k} \\nu_{k}^{(i)} R_{k} {q_{i} = \\sum_{k}\\nu_{k}^{(i)} Q_{k} {a}} Residual contribution is calculated by the solution-of-groups concept, and is defined as: \\ln \\gamma_{i}^{R} = \\underbrace{\\sum_{k}\\nu_{k}^{(i)}[\\ln \\Gamma_{k} - \\ln \\Gamma_{k}^{(i)}]}_\\text{all groups} The group activity coefficient $\\Gamma_{k}$ is found from a similar equation to UNIQUAC's residual contribution: \\ln \\Gamma_{k} = Q_{k} \\left [1 - \\ln(\\sum_{m}\\Theta_{m}\\Psi_{mk}) - \\sum_{m}\\left(\\frac{\\Theta_{m} \\Psi_{km}}{\\sum_{n}\\Theta_{n} \\Psi_{nm}}\\right)\\right] $\\Theta_{m}$ is calculated in a similar way to $\\theta_{i}$: \\Theta_{m} = \\frac{Q_{m}X_{m}}{\\sum_{n}Q_{n}X_{n}} The groups interaction parameter $\\Psi_{mn}$ is given by: \\Psi_{mn} = exp - \\left[\\frac{U_{mn}-U_{nm}}{RT}\\right] = exp - (a_{mn}/T) UNIFAC pioneered the use of group-contribution on models for the prediction of activity coefficients of non-electrolytes, and showed good success on predicting binary and multi-component mixtures where little or no experimental data was available. It's initial scope of compounds and temperature range was expanded with new developments. Inside JCOSMO several UNIFAC variants are available, in the following sections these variants will be described briefly. UNIFAC-LLE As a development to the original UNIFAC model, in 1981 Magnussen et al. 2 proposed a parameter table specially calculated for Liquid-Liquid Equilibira (LLE). Changing the data used for estimation of the UNIFAC prameters from VLE data to LLE data reduced the AAD for ternary LLE systems in almost 80\\%. While UNIFAC-LLE is limited to the available parameters, it still retain some advantages when working with molecules and systems that were part of the parameter estimation process. UNIFAC(Do) With the purpose of calculating vapor-liquid equilibria, activity coefficients at infinite dilution and enthalpies of mixing with just one set of parameters, Weidlich and Gmehling 3 modified the UNIFAC method with what is now known as UNIFAC(Do) - (Modified UNIFAC - Dortmund). UNIFAC(PSRK) The application of cubic equations of state (EoS) for the description of systems with supercritical compounds is a way to reduce the deviations in the model\u2019s predictions. For this purpose an approach with a coupled Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) equation with the original UNIFAC model was developed, UNIFAC(PSRK) 4 . This model allows an accurate prediction of phase equilibrium in a wide temperature and pressure range. Beside phase equilibria, equations of state provide other thermodynamic properties (enthalpies, densities). UNIFAC-NIST As more experimental data becomes available, there is a need for periodic updates of the parameter matrix of models to reflect the most recent information for phase equilibrium. UNIFAC-NIST 5 is a modified UNIFAC (with the same expression that of UNIFAC(Do) for both the combinatorial and residual contributions) with model parameters estimated with critically evaluated phase equilibrium data including vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium (VLE), liquid\u2013liquid equilibrium (LLE), solid\u2013liquid equilibrium (SLE), excess enthalpy (HE), infinite dilution activity coefficient (IDAC) and excess heat capacity (CPE) data. Data collected within the NIST SOURCE Data Archival System and processed through NIST ThermoData Engine were used in the parameter optimization process. Aage Fredenslund, Russell L.

The combinatorial part is taken as the same as the one in UNIQUAC \u2013 designed in a group-contribution scope \u2013 without modification. \\ln \\gamma_{i}^{C} = \\ln\\frac{\\Phi_{i}}{x_{i}} + \\frac{z}{2}q_{i}\\ln\\frac{\\theta_{i}}{\\Phi_{i}} + l_{i} - \\frac{\\Phi_{i}}{x_{i}} \\sum_{j}x_{j}l_{j} l_{J} = \\frac{z}{2} \\left(r_{i} - q_{i} \\right) - \\left( r_{i} -1 \\right)_{i} z = 10 \\theta_{i} = \\frac{q_{i}x_{i}}{\\sum_{j}q_{j}x_{j}} \\Phi_{i} = \\frac{r_{i}x_{i}}{\\sum_{j}r_{j}x_{j}} r_{i} = \\sum_{k} \\nu_{k}^{(i)} R_{k} {q_{i} = \\sum_{k}\\nu_{k}^{(i)} Q_{k} {a}} Residual contribution is calculated by the solution-of-groups concept, and is defined as: \\ln \\gamma_{i}^{R} = \\underbrace{\\sum_{k}\\nu_{k}^{(i)}[\\ln \\Gamma_{k} - \\ln \\Gamma_{k}^{(i)}]}_\\text{all groups} The group activity coefficient $\\Gamma_{k}$ is found from a similar equation to UNIQUAC's residual contribution: \\ln \\Gamma_{k} = Q_{k} \\left [1 - \\ln(\\sum_{m}\\Theta_{m}\\Psi_{mk}) - \\sum_{m}\\left(\\frac{\\Theta_{m} \\Psi_{km}}{\\sum_{n}\\Theta_{n} \\Psi_{nm}}\\right)\\right] $\\Theta_{m}$ is calculated in a similar way to $\\theta_{i}$: \\Theta_{m} = \\frac{Q_{m}X_{m}}{\\sum_{n}Q_{n}X_{n}} The groups interaction parameter $\\Psi_{mn}$ is given by: \\Psi_{mn} = exp - \\left[\\frac{U_{mn}-U_{nm}}{RT}\\right] = exp - (a_{mn}/T) UNIFAC pioneered the use of group-contribution on models for the prediction of activity coefficients of non-electrolytes, and showed good success on predicting binary and multi-component mixtures where little or no experimental data was available. It's initial scope of compounds and temperature range was expanded with new developments. Inside JCOSMO several UNIFAC variants are available, in the following sections these variants will be described briefly.","title":"UNIFAC"},{"location":"unifac/#unifac-lle","text":"As a development to the original UNIFAC model, in 1981 Magnussen et al. 2 proposed a parameter table specially calculated for Liquid-Liquid Equilibira (LLE). Changing the data used for estimation of the UNIFAC prameters from VLE data to LLE data reduced the AAD for ternary LLE systems in almost 80\\%. While UNIFAC-LLE is limited to the available parameters, it still retain some advantages when working with molecules and systems that were part of the parameter estimation process.","title":"UNIFAC-LLE"},{"location":"unifac/#unifacdo","text":"With the purpose of calculating vapor-liquid equilibria, activity coefficients at infinite dilution and enthalpies of mixing with just one set of parameters, Weidlich and Gmehling 3 modified the UNIFAC method with what is now known as UNIFAC(Do) - (Modified UNIFAC - Dortmund).","title":"UNIFAC(Do)"},{"location":"unifac/#unifacpsrk","text":"The application of cubic equations of state (EoS) for the description of systems with supercritical compounds is a way to reduce the deviations in the model\u2019s predictions.
